# Sorting Algorithms
## what is In Place sort ? ##
- In-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input with a
small, constant amount of extra storage space. The input is usually
overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes.

## What is stable sort ? ##
- An algorithm is said to be stable if it maintains the relative order
of records with equal keys.
- bubble sort , insertion sort , merge sort are stable sorting algorithms
- quick sort , heap sort are unstable sorting algorithms
